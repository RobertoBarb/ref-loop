# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please let us know immediately.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to fix the problem.

Our preference is that you make use of GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to disclose potential security vulnerabilities in our Open Source Software.

To do this, please visit the security tab of the repository and click the "Report a vulnerability" button.
